The impact of data science on our daily lives, and society more generally, has been tremendous. Much of data science has focused on extending and optimizing the underlying algorithms and technologies, often without considering how these algorithms and their concrete applications affect people and society. For instance, deep learning algorithms, once they have been trained, are essentially black-box routines, where nobody can explain or justify the outcomes of running the algorithm on new data: this becomes an issue when such algorithms are used for loan decisions, recommendations for parole or bail, or for hiring and salary recommendations. There are also legal issues since algorithms may discriminate against groups of individuals. For these reasons, and many others, it becomes increasingly important to think about biases, transparency, and fairness of machine-learning algorithms and training data sets. It is also important to communicate the limitations of data science algorithms in terms of fairness and accountability to non-experts who may not have the expertise to know what these limitations are.</p><p><button class=\"next-step\">Continue</button></p> <p>The Data &amp; Society course that you will take in the spring semester has two related goals. First, we will explore how data science impacts society more generally, and how to understand those impacts in our work as data scientists. Second, because data scientists have to communicate about their work to a general audience in their jobs, we will use this course as a way to improve our skills as data science communicators, primarily in writing. To prepare for the course, you'll do some reading and writing now, so that some of the issues we'll address in the spring are in your minds as you learn data science techniques in the fall. You will also get some feedback now on your writing, so that you know what will be expected in this graduate program.</p><p><button class=\"next-step\">Continue</button></p><p>To prepare for the course, you will do some reading and writing now, so that some of the issues we will address in the spring are in your minds as you learn data-science techniques in the fall.

The goal is to design word embeddings so that words with similar meaning are mapped to vectors that are close to each other (as measured by their angle or distance). Many word embeddings are based on co-occurence counts: which words frequently appear together in the same document? The idea behind this design is that words that occur together in a given document should share similar meaning. Word embeddings are useful since they can streamline search engines (if people search for the same topic using different but similar words) or infer meaning from texts.</p><p><button class=\"next-step\">Continue</button></p><hr> <p>To understand the impacts of word embeddings that have biases, we will look at two types of harm that algorithms can cause, namely representational and allocative. A <em>representational</em> harm reinforces existing stereotypes we may have of people: they may therefore amplify existing social biases. An <em>allocative</em> harm occurs when a decision-making system allocates opportunity, goods, or services in a biased manner.</p><p>Biased word embeddings are a(n) <x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-0\"><button class=\"choice\">representational</button><button class=\"choice\">allocative</button></x-blank-mc> harm because they are often used for <span class=\"nowrap\"><x-blank-mc goal=\"blank-1\"><button class=\"choice\">search engines</button><button class=\"choice\">making loan decisions</button></x-blank-mc>.</span></p><div class=\"exercise\"> <p><strong>Exercise</strong> </p><p>With the following exercise, we aim to accomplish three goals: (i) learn more about biases in word embeddings, (ii) learn how to read technical papers, and (iii) begin to write brief summaries for a general non-expert audience.
